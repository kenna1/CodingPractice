'''
Given a string and a non-negative int n, we'll say that the front of the string is the first 3 chars,
or whatever is there if the string is less than length 3. Return n copies of the front;

front_times('Chocolate', 2) → 'ChoCho'
front_times('Chocolate', 3) → 'ChoChoCho'
front_times('Abc', 3) → 'AbcAbcAbc'

#find the first 3 characters and store in variable c
# loop through array: while iterator is less than n
    #Add 3 characters to new variable
    #increment iterator

#return new variable
